<p>Get Vaccinated and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html" target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccines</a> are effective at preventing you from getting sick. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.</li>
  <li>Getting vaccinated is the best way to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</li>
  <li>CDC recommends that everyone who is eligible stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, including people with weakened immune systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wear a mask</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>Everyone ages 2 years and older should properly wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html"target="_blank">well-fitting mask</a>  indoors in public in areas of substantial or high community transmission, regardless of vaccination status.</li>
  <li>Improve how well your mask protects you, and learn about how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html" target="_blank">choose a mask </a> to protect yourself and others.</li>
  <li>In general, people do not need to wear masks when outdoors. In areas of substantial or high transmission, people might choose to wear a mask outdoors when in sustained close contact with other people, particularly if
<ol class="b">
<li>They or someone they live with has a weakened immune system or is at increased risk for severe disease.</li>
<li>They are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines or live with someone who is not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay 6 feet away from others</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick, if possible. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. If you are taking care of someone who is sick, make sure you properly wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html">well-fitting mask </a>and follow other steps to protect yourself</li>
  <li>Indoors in public: If you are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, especially if you are at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19.</li>
</ul>

  <li><b>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth</b> with unwashed hands.</li>
</ul>
